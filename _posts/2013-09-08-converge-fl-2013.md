  Just went on a trip to Florida, including visiting my college town and attending
  UnmatchedStyle's Converge Florida in Jacksonville, FL. It was an entirely inspiring
  weekend and I learned a lot.

This week, I took a trip to Florida to attend [ConvergeFL](http://convergefl.com) and see old college buddies. Converge was amazing and I'm so glad [Carl](http://twitter.com/carlsmith) asked me to attend. I learned so much, just like I did at [Artifact](http://artifactconf.com). I think the reason that is, is because conferences that run one or two tracks and allow attendees to stay in one or few rooms rather than run around the whole city are better for the attendees. A lot of those larger conferences say that because they are larger, people are exposed to more different views, but both ConvergeFL and Artifact have proved that its about maintaining the content, no matter what the scale is. [UnMatchedStyle](http://www.unmatchedstyle.com) brought in TV app designers and a musician who built his own instruments implementing technology to create new sounds [Moldover](http://www.moldover.com). They had some folks show code, while others spoke on leadership. I collected [stories](http://www.storify.com/samkap) the first day, and just took notes for myself on the second. I've been to Jacksonville quite a bit for Florida-Georgia football games, and it was nice to enjoy the city as a designer and not a Florida Gator. Jacksonville is buzzing with a new energy I have never seen there before and the designers there are putting Jacksonville on the design map for the rest of the world to see. Also, they have a [food truck with amazing grilled cheese sandwiches](https://twitter.com/HappyGrilledChs) and a beautiful [craft brewery](http://aardwolfbeer.com/).
