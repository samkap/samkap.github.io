[Monument Valley](http://www.monumentvalleygame.com/) is easily one of the best games<sup>1</sup> I’ve ever played. Every part of the game is perfection, and every detail is delightful and soothing. Even more, the Monument Valley Soundtrack (below) is absolutely stunning. It’s been out on iTunes for a while, but was just added today on <strike>Rdio,</strike> Spotify, and others according to [Jason Kottke](http://kottke.org/14/08/monument-valley-soundtrack).

If you haven’t already played the game by digital product studio, [UsTwo](http://www.ustwo.com), [download it](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/monument-valley/id728293409?mt=8) ASAP. It is worth every penny. The devs behind the game are working on the next level of stages, and I’ve found myself in a whole new place with my (excited) impatience.

And, if you’re super into this game like everyone I know are, here some other cool MV links:
