We're back at The White House to rep The Iron Yard and join in on the announcement of [The Tech Opportunity Fund](http://techopportunityfund.org) that we are so excited and passionate about:

"The Iron Yard and Code Fellows, in collaboration with Operation Hope, last week launched Tech Opportunity Fund with $45 million in diversity scholarships, and goal of awarding $100 million in scholarships over five years."

Jessica Mitsch, our Executive Director of the Code School, and I, were at the White House today for the [#CSforAll](http://twitter.com/search?q=csforall&src=typd) event where more announcements related to President Obama's Computer Science initiatives were made.
