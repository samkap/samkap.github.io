The Web Design class started last week in Austin, and it was really exciting to get the class going here. We moved into our second space at [Penn Field](https://www.google.com/maps/place/penn+field+austin/@30.226462,-97.759832,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x5fffd51e74a7c8bd?sa=X&ei=ZcHQVIy4GcOqNpe8gogF&ved=0CIEBEPwSMAo), and we're right next to Opal Divine's, which has a great selection of draft beers AND breakfast tacos with crispy hashbrowns in them.

The students have learned HTML, CSS, Git, Github, file naming and folder structural rules, and all the fun and equally annoying things about floats, displays, and positioning elements on a page. They've enjoyed eating pizza, penned a few CodePens, introduced themselves at the [ATX Dribbble Meetup](http://twitter.com/atxdribbble), worked during lab with our garage door wide open, and jammed out during #IronPints with the Front End and Ruby students. They've even said hello to our new fish! (I'm so glad my old fish tank is being used again!) It’s been a great week, and I can’t wait to see how the rest of the 11 weeks go.

Here are some of those moments:
