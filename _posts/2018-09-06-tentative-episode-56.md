My amazing [thoughtbot](http://www.thoughtbot.com) coworker and former Iron Yard student, Dawn, and I have a new episode of Tentative, filling in for regular hosts, Kyle and Jaclyn. Dawn and I spoke about Emoji day, our latest projects, entomology and etymology, Dawn's expertise on designing filter systems, and how design and business goals align. It was such a fun episode to record.
